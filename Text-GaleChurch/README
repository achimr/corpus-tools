Text-GaleChurch version 1.00
============================

This module aligns the sentences of paragraphs in two languages in a way that 
the aligned sentences are likely translations of each other. This is useful for 
applications in machine translation and other applications where 
sentence-aligned parallel corpora are needed. The algorithm used for this is 
described in the paper "A Program for Aligning Sentences in Bilingual Corpora" 
by William A. Gale and Kenneth W. Church (Computational Linguistics, 1994). 
The input to the align function are two arrays with sentences from the source 
language and target language text. The arrays need to contain one sentence 
per array element. To split paragraphs into sentences the module 
Lingua::Sentence can be used.
