=head1 NAME

Lingua::Sentence - Perl extension for breaking text paragraphs into sentences

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Lingua::Sentence;

	my $splitter = Lingua::Sentence->new("en");

	my $text = 'This is a paragraph. It contains several sentences. "But why," you ask?';

	print $splitter->split($text);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows splitting of text paragraphs into sentences. It is based on scripts developed by Philipp Koehn and Josh Schroeder for processing the Europarl corpus (L<http://www.statmt.org/europarl/>).

The module uses punctuation and capitalization clues to split paragraphs into an newline-separated string with one sentence per line. For example:

	This is a paragraph. It contains several sentences. "But why," you ask?

goes to:

	This is a paragraph.
	It contains several sentences.
	"But why," you ask?

Languages currently supported by the module are:

=over


=item Catalan

=item Czech

=item Dutch

=item English

=item French

=item German

=item Greek

=item Hungarian

=item Icelandic

=item Italian

=item Latvian

=item Polish

=item Portuguese

=item Russian

=item Spanish

=head2 Nonbreaking Prefixes Files

Nonbreaking prefixes are loosely defined as any word ending in a period that does NOT indicate an end of sentence marker. A basic example is Mr. and Ms. in English.

The sentence splitter module uses the nonbreaking prefix files included in this distribution.

To add a file for other languages, follow the naming convention nonbreaking_prefix.?? and use the two-letter language code you intend to use when creating a Lingua::Sentence object.

The sentence splitter module will first look for a file for the language it is processing, and fall back to English if a file
for that language is not found.

For the splitter, normally a period followed by an uppercase word results in a sentence split. If the word preceeding the period
is a nonbreaking prefix, this line break is not inserted.

A special case of prefixes, NUMERIC_ONLY, is included for special cases where the prefix should be handled ONLY when before numbers.
For example, "Article No. 24 states this." the No. is a nonbreaking prefix. However, in "No. It is not true." No functions as a word.

See the example prefix files included in the distribution for more examples.

=head3 CREDITS

Thanks for the following individuals for supplying nonbreaking prefix files:
Bas Rozema (Dutch), HilE<aacute>rio Leal Fontes (Portuguese), JesE<uacute>s GimE<eacute>nez (Catalan & Spanish), Anne-Kathrin Schumann (Russian)

=head2 EXPORT

=over

=item new($lang_id)

Instantiate an object to split sentences in language $lang_id. If the language is not supported, a splitter object for English will be instantiated.

=item new($lang_id,$nonbreaking_prefix_file)

Instantiate an object to split sentences in language $lang_id and the nonbreaking prefix file $nonbreaking_prefix_file. If the file does not exist, a splitter object for English will be instantiated.

=item split($text)

Split sentences in $text by inserting newline characters at the sentence breaks. The resulting string is also terminated with a newline.

=item split_array($text)

Split sentences in $text into an array of sentences.
